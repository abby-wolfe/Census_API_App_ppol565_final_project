# Census_API_App_ppol565_final_project
This project uses the Census API to retrieve data from the 2020 ACS 5-year estimates about food insecurity and then make a streamlit app with a visualization dashboard

The goal of this project is to de-stigmatize social safety net programs like SNAP by giving a holisitic view of the demographic factors that could potentially influence whether someone is eligible for SNAP. By analyzing state trends on a macro level rather than looking at individual determinants, we can get a better picture as to what makes up communities that need better access to nutrition. For instance, by analyzing renting and mortgage rates, we can see what role cost of living plays in SNAP eligibility. Or, by analyzing educational attainment, we can see what role economic mobility plays in SNAP eligibility. Presenting data in this way helps us understand the bigger picture of food insecurity and who it affects.
